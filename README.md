 # Code Snippets
 some codes snippets I found interesting was when I was working with the inquirer
 inquirer this is how I set the prompts up 
  <script>
  ```.prompt([
    {
        type: 'checkbox',
        message: 'What Technology you used',
        name: "tech",
        choices:[`CSS`,`HTML`,`Javascript`],
    }, 
    {
        name: 'email',
        message: "Enter email"```
        </script>
